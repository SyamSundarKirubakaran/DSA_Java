Array Problems:
- One -> Linear Search
- Two -> Binary Search
- Three -> Find a pair in an array whose sum is equal to given number (Hash Approach) - Brute Force, Quick Sort and search complement, Hash Table
- Four -> Element that occurs more than n/2 times - Unsorted
- Five -> Element that occurs more than n/2 times - Sorted
- Six -> Largest Difference such that the smaller number appears before larger number - Maximum Sum Sub-array
- Seven -> Largest Difference such that the smaller number appears before larger number - Maximum Sum Sub-array - Less space complexity
- Eight -> Largest Difference such that the smaller number appears before larger number - Min So Far
- Nine -> Find the number occurring odd number of times in the given array(Only one element occurs odd number of times)
- Ten -> Separate 0's and 1's in an array
- Eleven -> Separate Even and Odd numbers in an array
- Twelve -> 2 elements whose sum is close to zero - either positive or negative
- Thirteen -> 3 elements such that their sum is equal to x.
- Fourteen -> Find the Equilibrium Index .i.e., left sum and right sum of index should be equal.
- Fifteen -> Find the Equilibrium Index .i.e., left sum and right sum of index should be equal - Less Space Complexity.
- Sixteen -> Array of unknown size.0s followed by 1s find the first index of 1
- Seventeen -> Maximum of every contiguous sub-array of size k. - Sliding Window.
- Eighteen -> count the no.of smaller elements to the right of each element in the array.
- Nineteen -> Largest Multiple of 3 with given digits.
- Twenty -> Sub Array Sum equal to x
- TwentyOne -> Find Sub Array whose sum is equals zero
- TwentyTwo -> Largest sub array with equal no.of zeros and ones
- TwentyThree -> Construct a product array such that the ith element in product array contains the product of all the remaining elements but i (Without Division)
- TwentyFour -> Construct a product array such that the ith element in product array contains the product of all the remaining elements but i (Without Division) - less time complexity
- TwentyFive -> Sort a nearly sorted array, each element can be misplaced by a max of k digits before or after
- TwentySix -> Find Duplicates in O(n) time and O(1) space - Array element values are <= Max Index
- TwentySeven -> Find 2 repeating elements in a given array - XOR - Given (n+2) elements - 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n - All elements from 1 to n occurs at least once (Except the 2 numbers that occurs twice)
- TwentyEight -> Rotate an array of size n by d elements - Left rotation - Beginning to End - Juggling Algorithm
- TwentyNine -> Sort array in wave form - Even position number
- Thirty -> Next least greater number to the given number, input as digit array - with same digits
- ThirtyOne -> Trapping Rain Water Problem
- ThirtyTwo -> No.of Triangles that can be formed
- ThirtyThree -> Smallest number that can't be formed from the array of given numbers
- ThirtyFour -> Rearrange such that a[i] becomes a[a[i]]
- ThirtyFive -> Rotate Matrix by 90 degree - anti-clockwise
