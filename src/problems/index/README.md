Array Problems:
- One -> Linear Search
- Two -> Binary Search
- Three -> Find a pair in an array whose sum is equal to given number (Hash Approach) - Brute Force, Quick Sort and search complement, Hash Table
- Four -> Element that occurs more than n/2 times - Unsorted
- Five -> Element that occurs more than n/2 times - Sorted
- Six -> Largest Difference such that the smaller number appears before larger number - Maximum Sum Sub-array
- Seven -> Largest Difference such that the smaller number appears before larger number - Maximum Sum Sub-array - Less space complexity
- Eight -> Largest Difference such that the smaller number appears before larger number - Min So Far
- Nine -> Find the number occurring odd number of times in the given array(Only one element occurs odd number of times)
- Ten -> Separate 0's and 1's in an array
- Eleven -> Separate Even and Odd numbers in an array
- Twelve -> 2 elements whose sum is close to zero - either positive or negative
- Thirteen -> 3 elements such that their sum is equal to x.
- Fourteen -> Find the Equilibrium Index .i.e., left sum and right sum of index should be equal.
- Fifteen -> Find the Equilibrium Index .i.e., left sum and right sum of index should be equal - Less Space Complexity.
- Sixteen -> Array of unknown size.0s followed by 1s find the first index of 1
- Seventeen -> Maximum of every contiguous sub-array of size k. - Sliding Window.
- Eighteen -> count the no.of smaller elements to the right of each element in the array.
- Nineteen -> Largest Multiple of 3 with given digits.
- Twenty -> Sub Array Sum equal to x
- TwentyOne -> Find Sub Array whose sum is equals zero
- TwentyTwo -> Largest sub array with equal no.of zeros and ones
- TwentyThree -> Construct a product array such that the ith element in product array contains the product of all the remaining elements but i
