## Array Problems
### Questions to Ask:
- Is the Array Sorted?
- Does it have negative elements?
- Does it have repeated elements?
- Am I allowed to mutate the array elements in place?
- Am I allowed to copy / create duplicates of the array?
- Are there any restrictions I should know about before I start?
- I'm assuming this is a fixed length array and not a stream of data.

### Points:
- Makes sure you understand `Arrays.sort()` with the Comparator operator strong - will come in handy.
- Make sure you know how to sort an array of objects based on a given field.
- Make sure you kow how to sort 2 arrays at the same time.
- Make sure you ask for sample inputs and outputs - give custom inputs yourself and ask if the output is right before even solving the problem.
- Of course, correctly determine time complexity.
- Constantly try to come up with solutions with lower complexity until the interviewer says it's good enough.
